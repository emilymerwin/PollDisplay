# settingup
- Save your spreadsheet to the `/data/` directory as a CSV and name it [month]-[year]-poll.csv. Most importantly, no spaces are allowed in the URL.
- Open `/dist/settings.json` and fill in your values. The fieldnames MUST be in the same order as the spreadsheet. If you do not want a column to appear in the results, delete the column in Excel, save it, and save again as CSV. If you change the order or skip a column, the data will display with the wrong demographic group.
